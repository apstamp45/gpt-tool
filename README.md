# GPT Tool

This is a command line tool used to communicate with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

# How to use

Before use, you must have an internet connection, and you must have an OpenAI API key. Set the environment variable <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> to your OpenAI API key. The program will need to use this to get a response from ChatGPT. Then to run the program, simply run <code>python main.py</code> from this directory.

# TODO

- Add method to save chats to file
- If possible, colorize text to differentiate ChatGPT's and your text
- Maybe: port to tool to ncurses to make a more interactive interface?
- Add multiple undo's possible.
