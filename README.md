# GPT Tool

This tool, written in Python, is used to communicate with OpenAI's ChatGPT through the command line/terminal.

# How to use

To use, you must have an internet connection, and you must have an OpenAI API key. Set the environment variable <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> to your OpenAI API key. The program will need to use this to get a response from ChatGPT. Then to run the program, simply run <code>python main.py</code> from this directory.

# TODO

- Add method to save chats to file (DONE?)
- If possible, colorize text to differentiate ChatGPT's and your text (DONE)
- Make multiple undo's possible.
- Catch errors such as internet issues and API key errors. (hopefully done)
- Make a function to clear the chat. (Added TWO)
- Make config file available.
- Add configuration options changable via command line options.
