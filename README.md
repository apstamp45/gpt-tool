# GPT Tool

This tool, written in Python, is used to communicate with OpenAI's ChatGPT model through the command line/terminal.

# How to use

To get this program to work, you must first install the <code>openai</code> Python module, then you must set the <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> enviorment variable to your personal API key (on Linux, you can put <code>OPENAI_API_KEY=insert_api_key_here</code> in your .bashrc/.zshrc file then reload the terminal). You can obtain this through OpenAI's website.
To use the program, you must have an internet connection then run the program by running <code>python main.py</code> from this directory.

# TODO

- Catch errors such as internet issues and API key errors. (hopefully done)
- Make config file available.
- Add a redo function
- Add support for Windows users
